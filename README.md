# About
hentaishell is basically just zsh, except.. filled with hentai?

hentaishell is based on Z Shell (zsh): \
git://git.code.sf.net/p/zsh/code \
Mirror: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh

About the missing source code; I won't ever put most of it here since if I did GitHub would end me; \
however, ```hentaishell.zip``` should contain everything. If anything, everything can be found on \
```/opt/hentaishell```. Nothing is compiled, and can be easily accessed.
